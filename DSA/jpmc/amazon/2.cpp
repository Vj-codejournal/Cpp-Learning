On each coin there are two numbers one on the front(Pi) and on the back(Qi) .the sequences P = {P1, P2, ..., Pn} and Q = {Q1, Q2, ..., Qn} are premutations of the numbers from 1 to N.meaning tehy contain all numbers from 1 to N in some order means a coin can have 
Your task is to count the number ot ways you can choose a subset of these coins such that every number from 1 to N appears at least once on either the front or the back of a chosen coin.
